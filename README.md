Chinese Body Clock in Traditional Chinese Medicine

The Chinese Body Clock associates specific two-hour time periods each day with the optimal functioning of a different organ or body system.
Many TCM practitioners use the Chinese Body Clock as a tool to help them diagnose health concerns.

Chinese Medicine's 24-hour body clock is divided into 12 two-hour intervals. During each interval, our Qi (vital life force, also known as "prana") moves through the body, focusing on a specific organ meridian.  **While we sleep, Qi is drawn inward to rejuvenate the body**. This process is completed between 1 and 3 A.M., when the liver cleanses the blood and performs various functions to prepare the body for Qi to move outward again.

Exactly 12 hours  _after_  "liver time" ends (from 3 A.M. to 3 P.M.), the energy cycles of organs associated with  **activity rather than rest and repair**  take place, such as digestion and elimination. These organs include the  _lungs, large intestine, stomach, spleen/pancreas, heart, and small intestine_.

After 3 P.M., the energy flow begins moving inward again to support internal organs involved in system repair. This phase helps circulate fluids and heat, as well as filter and cleanse. This time affects the  _pericardium, triple burner (which coordinates water functions and temperature), bladder, kidneys, circulation/sex, and liver_.

When one organ is at its peak energy, the organ on the opposite side of the clock, 12 hours away, is at its lowest function. For instance, between 1 and 3 A.M., the liver is at its peak, cleansing the blood. Meanwhile, the small intestine (responsible for nutrient absorption and assimilation) is at its lowest activity level – a good reason to avoid eating in the middle of the night!

### How Qi Runs Within 24 Hours

Qi flows through the body in a cyclical pattern, moving through different organ meridians at specific times of the day. Here's a breakdown of the 24-hour Qi cycle:

1.  **3 A.M. - 5 A.M.**: Lung time - Qi is strongest in the lungs, promoting respiration and oxygenation.
2.  **5 A.M. - 7 A.M.**: Large Intestine time - Optimal time for elimination and detoxification.
3.  **7 A.M. - 9 A.M.**: Stomach time - Best time for digestion and nutrient absorption.
4.  **9 A.M. - 11 A.M.**: Spleen time - Supports digestion and energy production.
5.  **11 A.M. - 1 P.M.**: Heart time - Enhances circulation and cardiovascular function.
6.  **1 P.M. - 3 P.M.**: Small Intestine time - Absorption of nutrients and separation of fluids.
7.  **3 P.M. - 5 P.M.**: Bladder time - Promotes fluid metabolism and elimination.
8.  **5 P.M. - 7 P.M.**: Kidney time - Supports filtration and detoxification.
9.  **7 P.M. - 9 P.M.**: Pericardium time - Protects the heart and supports emotional balance.
10.  **9 P.M. - 11 P.M.**: Triple Burner time - Coordinates water metabolism and temperature regulation.
11.  **11 P.M. - 1 A.M.**: Gallbladder time - Aids in digestion and bile secretion.
12.  **1 A.M. - 3 A.M.**: Liver time - Cleanses the blood and detoxifies the body.

### Impact on Mental Health

The flow of Qi through the body not only affects physical health but also has a significant impact on mental health
-   **Stress Reduction**: Balanced Qi flow helps reduce stress and promotes relaxation, which can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression.
-   **Emotional Balance**: Proper Qi circulation supports emotional stability and helps manage mood swings.
-   **Improved Sleep**: Harmonizing Qi flow can improve sleep quality, which is crucial for mental well-being.
-   **Enhanced Focus and Clarity**: A balanced Qi flow can enhance cognitive functions, leading to better focus and mental clarity.
-   **Overall Well-being**: Regular practices like Qigong and Tai Chi, which promote smooth Qi flow, contribute to overall mental and emotional health.
